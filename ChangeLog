	* src/IIOP/giop-msg-buffer.c (giop_recv_message_buffer_use):
	Denial of service prevention.  Do not allocate more than 8k on the
	initial message.

	This code still has issues.  The attacker can just telnet to the
	local port and start typing, he will be able to freeze any
	CORBA-aware application if he keeps the connection open and never
	finishes.
