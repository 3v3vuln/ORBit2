	Please log all patches/bug-reports bugzilla.gnome.org and get
approval from myself(Mark), Michael or Elliot before committing.

	If you don't think bugzilla is appropriate, send a mail to
orbit-list@gnome.org.

	If you don't receive any feedback within a resonable amount of
time, go ahead and commit, but please CC the list as you commit.
