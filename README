Code for an ORB written in C will spontaneously evolve here. C, ObjC, and
Scheme bindings will be supported, eventually. (OK that's a lie. It has
been over a year now and nobody has done much about any languages except
C.)

ORBit is part of the GNU project, and is a GNU program. For more
information on the Free Software Foundation and GNU, visit
http://www.gnu.org/

The ORBit web page is currently at http://www.labs.redhat.com/orbit/
Please send bug reports to orbit-list and/or the AUTHORS.

Read 'NEWS', 'TODO', and 'docs/*' if you're bored.
