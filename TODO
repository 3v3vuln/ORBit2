TODO:

idl-compiler:

	memory management
	. Get all the MN_TOPLEVEL details & impl worked out
		- write standard routines for "print out the variables I need". Also make all immediate children of a toplevel
		just be MN_NEED_TMPVAR and allocate that way...
	. Fix the demarshalling code to use the hints (fun fun!)
	. Right now the skels put an 'if(ev->_major == CORBA_NO_EXCEPTION)' for every item that needs freeing.
	Group things up properly.

	bounds checking
	. need some sort of expression tree thing
	typedef struct {
		int required_size;
		char *varname;
	} OIDL_Marshal_Bounds_Requirements;
